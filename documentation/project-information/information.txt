1. Time-based Parameters
These parameters capture temporal variations in bandwidth usage:

Time of Day: Hourly data to detect peak and off-peak usage times.
Day of the Week: Patterns can vary between weekdays and weekends.
Month of the Year: Seasonal trends affecting bandwidth (e.g., holidays or fiscal year-end activities).
2. User/Department Activity Parameters
These parameters capture usage patterns for different offices, departments, or individuals:

Department ID: Unique identifier for each department or office.
Number of Active Users: Total number of users actively connected at a given time.
Type of Department Activity: Categories like streaming, online meetings, or file downloads.
Concurrent Applications: Number of simultaneous applications used in the department.
3. Bandwidth Usage Parameters
These parameters quantify how bandwidth is consumed:

Current Bandwidth Utilization: Real-time data on bandwidth consumed at any given time.
Average Bandwidth Usage: Historical average bandwidth usage for a specific time or department.
Peak Bandwidth Usage: Maximum bandwidth usage recorded during a period.
Bandwidth Utilization Trends: Rate of increase or decrease in usage over time.
4. Application Usage Parameters
Specific to applications consuming bandwidth:

Application Type: Categories like video streaming, video conferencing, file transfer, etc.
Data Consumed by Application: Total data (in MB/GB) consumed by each application.
Frequency of Usage: How often a particular application is accessed.
Allowed Applications: Usage statistics for applications explicitly permitted by the system administrator.
5. Network Parameters
Factors affecting overall network performance:

Network Latency: Delays in data transmission due to high bandwidth consumption.
Packet Loss: Number of packets dropped during transmission, potentially due to congestion.
Connection Stability: Downtime or fluctuation in the quality of the internet connection.
6. Predictive Indicators
Derived or calculated metrics to enhance predictive capabilities:

Bandwidth Forecast Deviation: The difference between actual and forecasted usage in previous cycles.
Usage Patterns: Historical data that identifies recurring trends (e.g., bandwidth spikes during specific meetings).
Threshold Exceedance History: Number of times a department exceeded its allocated bandwidth.
7. User-defined Policies and Rules
These parameters incorporate administrator-set rules:

Bandwidth Allocation Limit: Predefined bandwidth limits for departments.
Priority Levels: Specific departments or applications given high or low priority.
Time-based Restrictions: Policies restricting or enabling certain applications at specific times.
8. External Factors
Data from external environments that may impact bandwidth:

Weather Conditions: Can affect internet usage patterns, especially in remote or hybrid work setups.
Special Events or Holidays: Increased bandwidth usage during events like webinars or holidays.
Network Upgrades or Downtime: Scheduled maintenance or upgrades affecting usage trends.
Example Model Features
Using the parameters, a predictive model might include:

Input Features:
Time of day, day of the week, active users, application type, current bandwidth utilization, and latency.
Output Labels (Predictions):
Bandwidth usage forecast (e.g., in Mbps or GB), department likely to exceed limits, and high-usage applications.
Techniques
The model could leverage time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM), classification models for priority recommendations, or regression models to forecast bandwidth requirements. Combining historical data and real-time monitoring ensures accurate predictions and actionable insights.
